## Installation

First, add the following Maven dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.yourorganization</groupId>
        <artifactId>GuardianTemplates</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

After adding the dependency, execute the following Maven command:

## Usage

The general structure of using the templates in GuardianTemplates is as follows:

```java
import com.yourorganization.GuardianTemplates.UserService;

public class MyUserService extends UserService {
    // Override the methods from UserService as per your business logic
}
```

In this example, `MyUserService` class is extending the `UserService` class template from the GuardianTemplates package. You can override the methods as per your requirements.
